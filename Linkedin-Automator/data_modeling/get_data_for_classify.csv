1,"""The Intern"" – A Lesson on the Untapped Potential of Experienced TalentA while back, I watched the movie *The Intern*, and it resonated deeply with me. It wasn’t just entertainment—it felt like a reflection of my own story. Having worked with an international airline that upheld exceptional business ethics, a professional team, and world-class HR standards, I know firsthand the value of experience, passion, and dedication.This film is a reminder of something we often overlook in the corporate world: the immense potential of experienced professionals who are eager to restart their careers.Many retirees—myself included—are not just willing but passionate about contributing again. We bring decades of expertise, stability, and a strong work ethic that can create synergy when combined with fresh, qualified talent.Yet, in Pakistan (and elsewhere), thousands of skilled professionals retire every year—many of whom are ready to continue working immediately or after a short break. The best part? This experienced talent is often available at a fraction of the cost of hiring a fresh but inexperienced resource.So, here’s my appeal to HR professionals and business leaders:- Revisit your hiring strategies – Don’t let institutional knowledge walk out the door.- Leverage the power of mentorship – A mix of youth and experience drives innovation.- Consider flexible roles – Many retirees seek meaningful work, not just a paycheck.If you haven’t watched *The Intern*, I highly recommend it—not just as a movie but as a case study on why experience matters. And if you’re looking for someone who brings both expertise and passion, well… I’m retired, ready, and eager to contribute!Let’s rethink how we value talent—because age is just a number, but experience is an asset.hashtag#HRhashtag#TalentManagementhashtag#TheInternhashtag#ExperienceMattershashtag#SecondCareerhashtag#RetiredButNotDone Khalid SiddiquiKhalid Siddiqui ""The Intern"" – A Lesson on the Untapped Potential of Experienced TalentA while back, I watched the movie *The Intern*, and it resonated deeply with me.

I can’t begin to say enough about how much this role has taught me in the last two years and how many unforgettable opportunities I was given with it. Hiring someone who had no idea on how to use a camera was probably not the safest decision, but it will definitely not be forgotten. I owe you all more than a thank you for the guidance and inspiration to make great things in this pursuit of a career. Looking back on the projects from my time here, I think this senior tribute best exemplifies my gratitude, and represents how much of a foundation I’ve gained.

However, in 2021, after graduating, I decided to start a bachelor’s degree in Artificial Intelligence at Groningen University- (Netherland), as it matched my 2 main goals: 1. to prepare for a future engineering career 2. to continue evolving in an international environment.

Derrick CramerDerrick Cramer How the hell am I supposed to justify hiring an intern or recent graduate in 2025?I already hear the agentic AI consortium laughing me out of timeline relevance as they vibe-code their way to another few million ARR (or at least a viral LinkedIn post).I’m not the only one worried.Aneesh Raman’s recent opinion inThe New York Timesdoes a great job explaining how the outsourcing of simple tasks to AI, rather than juniors, removes a critical way that young workers gain experience.If I didn’t write hundreds of 160-character long promotional SMSs every month forJosé Soaresback in 2013, or labour over monthly performance reports with (admittedly basic) Excel analysis, I doubt my LinkedIn ads would be among LinkedIn’s top 1% performers a decade later.We're fighting over academic talent (see the recentHarvard Universityvs Trump international student drama).

My advice:▶️ Split marketing into three pillars: Strategy, Production (writing content, building landing pages, launching digital campaigns), Operations (arranging events, submitting award proposals, setting up CRM workflows).▶️ Your Marketing leader should be doing all three. While significant time is spent on strategy, leadership should produce and run some operations to maintain perspective.▶️ Experts handle the bulk of production.

Stipend isn’t optional: If the intern is doing actual work (not just learning), a stipend is ethically and legally expected. Unpaid internships ≠ “great exposure.” That’s exploitation.2. Offer letters must be formal: An internship offer should mention duration, stipend, reporting manager, and work expectations. An email saying “Join from Monday” doesn’t count.3. Working hours matter: You can’t make interns work 9–6 like full-time employees. Especially without the legal structure of employment. Intern ≠ invisible employee.4.

315,"LinkedOut Diaries™ – Entry #022Title: How to Survive a 4-Round Interview Process That Ends in Ghosting (Spoiler: You Don’t)I went through four rounds.FOUR.Four interviews. Four fake laughs. Four outfit changes I couldn’t afford to wash again. One unpaid task that took three hours and a small piece of my soul.And you know what I got at the end of it all?Absolutely nothing. Not even a “sorry.”Just a slow, painful ghosting that haunts me like a bad situationship I thought was “different.”Let’s break it down, shall we?ROUND ONE: The Flirt.They slid into my inbox with “We were really impressed with your application!”And I believed them. Like a fool.I showed up smiley and prepared. I said words like “synergy” and “impact” while sitting on a broken chair. I thought, “Oh wow, they like me.”Ha. Cute.ROUND TWO: The Vibe Check.“Let’s meet the team!”I met the team. I charmed the team. I emotionally bonded with the team. I started imagining what my Slack profile photo would look like.They said things like:“You’re a strong candidate.”“We love your energy.”Translation: they were already hiring someone else but felt bad about it.ROUND THREE: The Task.“You’ll just need to complete a short assignment.”It was neither short, nor sane.It was 6 pages of strategy, three pages of writing, a spreadsheet, and a tiny existential crisis.I did it.Because I’m desperate. Because I’m a try-hard. Because I still believe work should feel meaningful.I even edited it in Canva so it would look pretty while they ignored it.ROUND FOUR: The Final Interview™I put on my good earrings.I said the word “passionate” four times.I referenced their mission statement. I even said I liked teamwork.I was lying through my teeth, but I did it with a smile because that’s what capitalism demands.And then?Nothing.No rejection. No “we’ve moved on.” No “thank you for your time.”Just ✨ghosted✨ like I never existed.And the worst part?I STILL CHECKED MY EMAIL FOR WEEKS.Like a fool. Like a love-struck intern waiting for their boss to notice them.The level of emotional whiplash this process gave me could fund an entire therapy arc.Conclusion?If your hiring process is going to be longer than a mini-series, the bare minimum you can do is send a freaking email at the end.This wasn’t just rejection.It was a slow-motion heartbreak served cold and silent.And now I walk through life with a permanent dent in my hope.So yeah, I survived. Barely.And if you're reading this while waiting to hear back from your own Fourth Round Fiasco™, just know:You deserved better.You still do.hashtag#LinkedOutDiarieshashtag#GhostedAfterRoundFourhashtag#HireMeOrDon’tButSaySomethinghashtag#ThisIsABreakupPostNowhashtag#OpenToWorkAndEmotionalReparations Mitchelle WambuiMitchelle Wambui LinkedOut Diaries™ – Entry #022Title: How to Survive a 4-Round Interview Process That Ends in Ghosting (Spoiler: You Don’t)I went through four rounds.FOUR.Four interviews.

In reality, what they’re exposed to is a broken system that thrives on free labor while preaching about “youth empowerment.”Let’s talk numbers. Convincing your family to let you work for free is hard enough but commuting, meals, clothing, and basic survival in a city like Lahore or Karachi easily costs PKR 15,000 to 30,000 a month. That’s the price students silently pay just to add a line on their CV.Companies that pride themselves on profitability still somehow expect students to work 9 to 5 without a single rupee in return.

Just the illusion of opportunity.Meanwhile, the ones who can afford these internships often belong to privileged backgrounds widening the already massive gap between the haves and have-nots.

720,"_Navigating the world of HR: Empathy vs. Experience 💼_My first week as an HR Intern has been a fascinating journey into the realities of recruitment. My background as a customer service representative instilled in me a deep sense of empathy – putting myself in others' shoes  – the ability to truly understand and share the feelings of others. Stepping into an HR role, I initially assumed this skill would directly translate.One early challenge has been reviewing countless CVs, many from individuals who, despite their enthusiasm, don't quite meet the specific requirements for the roles we're currently hiring for. It brings a certain sadness having to turn down these applications. The thought often crosses my mind: ""People can learn and grow on the job, can't we offer them a chance, even if their experience isn't a perfect match? Everyone has to start somewhere, right?""I voiced this very question to my boss: ""Why can't we process and submit CVs for roles that applicants are passionate about, even if they don't fully meet the stated criteria? Surely, a CV doesn't capture someone's full potential.""Her response provided valuable perspective, framed by a simple yet impactful scenario: ""If I were a business owner with little or no knowledge of handling social media space seeking a Social Media Manager with a specific level of proven experience, would it be wise to hire someone with absolutely no prior experience in that field?"" The answer, undeniably, was ""no.""This conversation has illuminated a crucial aspect of HR: while empathy is essential in understanding the aspirations of job seekers, effective recruitment also demands a level of strategic discretion to meet the specific needs and goals of the organization.This early stage of my HR journey is already teaching me the importance of this balance.
