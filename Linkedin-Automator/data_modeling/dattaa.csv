41,"LinkedOut Diaries™ – Entry #022Title: How to Survive a 4-Round Interview Process That Ends in Ghosting (Spoiler: You Don’t)I went through four rounds.FOUR.Four interviews. Four fake laughs. Four outfit changes I couldn’t afford to wash again. One unpaid task that took three hours and a small piece of my soul.And you know what I got at the end of it all?Absolutely nothing. Not even a “sorry.”Just a slow, painful ghosting that haunts me like a bad situationship I thought was “different.”Let’s break it down, shall we?ROUND ONE: The Flirt.They slid into my inbox with “We were really impressed with your application!”And I believed them. Like a fool.I showed up smiley and prepared. I said words like “synergy” and “impact” while sitting on a broken chair. I thought, “Oh wow, they like me.”Ha. Cute.ROUND TWO: The Vibe Check.“Let’s meet the team!”I met the team. I charmed the team. I emotionally bonded with the team. I started imagining what my Slack profile photo would look like.They said things like:“You’re a strong candidate.”“We love your energy.”Translation: they were already hiring someone else but felt bad about it.ROUND THREE: The Task.“You’ll just need to complete a short assignment.”It was neither short, nor sane.It was 6 pages of strategy, three pages of writing, a spreadsheet, and a tiny existential crisis.I did it.Because I’m desperate. Because I’m a try-hard. Because I still believe work should feel meaningful.I even edited it in Canva so it would look pretty while they ignored it.ROUND FOUR: The Final Interview™I put on my good earrings.I said the word “passionate” four times.I referenced their mission statement. I even said I liked teamwork.I was lying through my teeth, but I did it with a smile because that’s what capitalism demands.And then?Nothing.No rejection. No “we’ve moved on.” No “thank you for your time.”Just ✨ghosted✨ like I never existed.And the worst part?I STILL CHECKED MY EMAIL FOR WEEKS.Like a fool. Like a love-struck intern waiting for their boss to notice them.The level of emotional whiplash this process gave me could fund an entire therapy arc.Conclusion?If your hiring process is going to be longer than a mini-series, the bare minimum you can do is send a freaking email at the end.This wasn’t just rejection.It was a slow-motion heartbreak served cold and silent.And now I walk through life with a permanent dent in my hope.So yeah, I survived. Barely.And if you're reading this while waiting to hear back from your own Fourth Round Fiasco™, just know:You deserved better.You still do.hashtag#LinkedOutDiarieshashtag#GhostedAfterRoundFourhashtag#HireMeOrDon’tButSaySomethinghashtag#ThisIsABreakupPostNowhashtag#OpenToWorkAndEmotionalReparations Mitchelle WambuiMitchelle Wambui LinkedOut Diaries™ – Entry #022Title: How to Survive a 4-Round Interview Process That Ends in Ghosting (Spoiler: You Don’t)I went through four rounds.FOUR.Four interviews.
