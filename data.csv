I am currently looking for a 1- year apprenticeship program starting from September 2025.If you're hiring interns or apprentice in the field of data science or business intelligence, don't hesitate to reach out – I'm eager to explore future opportunities!Let me share a bit about myself: Although I am French, I grew up and spent most of my life in Hong Kong, China. However, in 2021, after graduating, I decided to start a bachelor’s degree in Artificial Intelligence at Groningen University- (Netherland), as it matched my 2 main goals: 1. to prepare for a future engineering career 2. to continue evolving in an international environment. After 2 years of very high-level academic courses, I realized that I aspired to find a better balance between theoretical learning and practical projects. The unique French system of alternating study (apprenticeship) convinced me to join ECE, a well-known computer science school.Thanks to my studies and various projects, I have acquired a solid foundation in programming (C, Python, C++, C#, API), data (Python, SQL Server, T-SQL, Hadoop, Power BI), and AI (TensorFlow, PyTorch).My goal lies in utilizing data-driven insights to propel business success, and I'm enthusiastic about learning and improving my expertise in this field. If you are looking for a junior eager to learn, hardworking with a positive mindset and a strong ability to adapt and integrate into a team, feel free to connect, and together, let's navigate the dynamic world of data!"", 'MyRepublic IDishashtag#hiring!PT Eka Mas Republik (member of Sinarmas) merupakan perusahaan yang bergerak di bidang Internet Service Provider (ISP).

But I wonder what we’ll do with that talent once they graduate. Deeptech research may consider itself safe, but after reading AI 2027 (https://ai-2027.com/) I wonder how long good “research appetite” will protect them.I don’t have answers to the above grand challenges, but I do discuss how marketing can tackle this today with clients, as well asGrowthMentormentees, regularly. My advice:▶️ Split marketing into three pillars: Strategy, Production (writing content, building landing pages, launching digital campaigns), Operations (arranging events, submitting award proposals, setting up CRM workflows).▶️ Your Marketing leader should be doing all three. While significant time is spent on strategy, leadership should produce and run some operations to maintain perspective.▶️ Experts handle the bulk of production. These can be in-house FTEs, agencies, freelancers or even AI agents, but the goal is top quality driven by deep experience.▶️ Operations is where interns and recent graduates can shine because mindset and execution, rather than hard-skills and knowledge, are the success factors. Exposure to domain experts and real-world scenarios accelerates the transition from academia to a career.The above should help fresh faces into the marketing workforce, upskill rapidly through exposure, and benefit from their creative thinking.It might not be as efficient over the short term as “AI everything”, but I’d letKlarnaCEOSebastian Siemiatkowski's recentBloomberginterview end with a note on cost vs. quality:Siemiatkowski said that [an all-in on AI for customer support] strategy isn’t the right fit any more. “As cost unfortunately seems to have been a too predominant evaluation factor when organizing this, what you end up having is lower quality,” he said. “Really investing in the quality of the human support is the way of the future for us.”How do we blend quality, cost-efficiency, and social obligation to the next generation of talent together?
